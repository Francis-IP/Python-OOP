Explanation
Smartphone Class:

The Smartphone class inherits from ElectronicDevice, which means it shares the properties like brand, model, and battery percentage.
The Smartphone class also has its own methods like make_call() and take_picture() specific to smartphones.
The charge_battery() method from ElectronicDevice is inherited, and it sets the battery percentage to 100.
Polymorphism in Action:

Both Car and Plane classes inherit from the Vehicle class and override the move() method. The Car class prints "Driving üöó", and the Plane class prints "Flying ‚úàÔ∏è".
In the loop, we treat both Car and Plane objects as instances of Vehicle, demonstrating polymorphism‚Äîeach object behaves according to its own class definition of move().
